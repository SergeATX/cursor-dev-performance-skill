# Engineering Performance Tracker

A Cursor skill that turns your Jira, GitHub, Confluence, and Google Calendar activity into structured, evidence-backed performance reports. Ask Cursor *"How did I do last quarter?"* and get a complete breakdown of delivery, code quality, review engagement, time investment, and influence -- ready for self-calibration, 1:1s, or promotion conversations.

## Why This Exists

Performance conversations should be driven by data, not memory. This tool gives every engineer a private, on-demand view of their own work -- so you can spot trends early, prepare for reviews with evidence, and have informed conversations with your manager about growth and impact.

It measures what matters:
- **Delivery** -- what you shipped and how efficiently (cycle time, lead time, throughput)
- **Code quality** -- PR discipline, CI pass rates, revert frequency
- **Time investment** -- meeting load, focus time, collaboration breadth
- **Multiplier effect** -- code reviews, influence radius, knowledge sharing
- **Initiative** -- self-created work, proactive problem identification

## What It Does

- Queries Jira for completed tickets, WIP, initiative, re-opens, cycle time, lead time
- Queries GitHub for merged PRs, PR size, reviews given, review turnaround, CI pass rate
- Queries Confluence for pages created and updated (knowledge sharing)
- Queries Google Calendar for meeting load, focus time, meeting types, collaboration breadth
- Computes derived metrics: bug-to-feature ratio, review-to-PR ratio, influence radius, focus ratio, quality signals
- Formats everything into a structured report with a health dashboard and observations
- Supports weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly reports
- Includes promotion-ready narratives and improvement goal tracking for quarterly/yearly reports

## Quick Start

1. Copy this folder to `~/.cursor/skills/dev-performance/`
2. Copy `config.example.md` to `config.md` and fill in your details
3. Restart Cursor, open agent mode, and ask: *"How did I do last week?"*

See [Setup](#setup) below for detailed instructions.

## Example Output

See [examples/sample-report.md](examples/sample-report.md) for a real monthly report generated by this skill. It demonstrates the structure, metrics, and level of detail you can expect.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **Cursor IDE** with agent mode enabled
2. **Jira MCP** -- install the Atlassian MCP server in Cursor (Settings > Tools & MCP). You need read access to your Jira projects.
3. **GitHub CLI** (`gh`) -- install and authenticate with `gh auth login`. Needs access to the repos you contribute to.
4. **Google Calendar MCP** (optional) -- adds meeting load, focus time, and collaboration metrics. See [Google Calendar Setup](#google-calendar-setup) below.

### Installation

1. Clone or copy this folder into your personal Cursor skills directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.cursor/skills
   cp -r dev-performance ~/.cursor/skills/dev-performance
   ```

   Or, if distributed via a git repo:

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url> ~/.cursor/skills/dev-performance
   ```

2. Create your personal config:

   ```bash
   cd ~/.cursor/skills/dev-performance
   cp config.example.md config.md
   ```

3. Edit `config.md` with your details:

   | Field | How to find it |
   |-------|---------------|
   | Jira Cloud ID | Ask Cursor: *"Call `getAccessibleAtlassianResources` from the `user-jira` MCP"* -- use the `id` field |
   | Jira Account ID | Ask Cursor: *"Look up my Jira account ID for `Your Name`"* |
   | GitHub Username | Run `gh api /user --jq '.login'` |
   | GitHub Org | Run `gh api /user/orgs --jq '.[].login'` |
   | Jira Projects | Add the project keys you work in (e.g., `ES`, `PLAT`). Check your Jira board. |
   | GitHub Repos | Add the repos you contribute to as `org/repo` pairs |
   | Status Mapping | Adjust if your Jira workflow uses different status names for "done" |
   | Calendar ID | Usually `primary` (your default Google Calendar) |
   | Work Hours | Your typical work hours (default: 9:00-18:00, Mon-Fri) |
   | Org Email Domain | Your company email domain (e.g., `acme.com`) -- used for meeting classification |

4. Restart Cursor (or start a new conversation) for the skill to be discovered.

### Verify It Works

Open a new Cursor agent conversation and ask:

```
How did I do last week?
```

The skill should produce a structured weekly report with Jira delivery metrics, GitHub code metrics, and observations.

## Usage Examples

```
How did I do last week?
Monthly performance report for January
Show me my quarterly stats
Compare my last two quarters
What's my review-to-PR ratio this month?
Give me my 2025 annual report
Show my improvement over the last 6 weeks
Prepare my promotion evidence for Q4
```

## Sharing and Distribution

This skill is designed to be shared. Each engineer gets their own private config while sharing the same query logic and report templates.

**Important:** `config.md` is excluded from version control via `.gitignore`. It contains personal identifiers (Jira account ID, GitHub username, project keys). Each person creates their own from `config.example.md`.

To distribute within your org:
1. Host this folder in an internal git repo
2. Share the repo URL with your team
3. Each engineer clones it, creates their `config.md`, and they're ready to go

## Current Capabilities

| Data Source | Status | Method |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| Jira | Active | Jira MCP (Atlassian official) |
| GitHub | Active | `gh` CLI (authenticated) |
| Confluence | Active | Jira MCP (shared server) |
| Google Calendar | Active | Google Calendar MCP (`@cocal/google-calendar-mcp`) |
| Slack | Pending | Requires workspace admin approval for official Slack MCP |

## Roadmap

- **Slack integration** -- add communication and influence metrics (thread participation, help channel activity). Blocked on workspace admin approval for the official Slack MCP server. See [Slack Integration](#slack-integration-future) below.
- **GitHub MCP** -- replace `gh` CLI with structured MCP when OAuth support for Cursor is available

## Google Calendar Setup

The Google Calendar MCP adds meeting load, focus time, and collaboration breadth to your reports. It uses OAuth 2.0 -- credentials stay on your machine.

**Steps:**

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a project (or use an existing one)
2. Enable the **Google Calendar API** (APIs & Services > Library > search "Google Calendar API")
3. Create **OAuth 2.0 credentials** (APIs & Services > Credentials > Create Credentials > OAuth client ID > Desktop app)
4. Download the credentials JSON file
5. Add your email as a **test user** (APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen > Audience > Add user)
6. Add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "google-calendar": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["@cocal/google-calendar-mcp"],
         "env": {
           "GOOGLE_OAUTH_CREDENTIALS": "/path/to/your/gcp-oauth.keys.json"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

7. Restart Cursor. The MCP will prompt for OAuth authentication in your browser on first use.

**Token refresh:** In test mode, tokens expire after 7 days. To avoid weekly re-auth, go to OAuth consent screen > PUBLISH APP in Google Cloud Console.

**Privacy:** Calendar data is queried on-demand and never stored. The MCP runs locally. No data leaves your machine beyond the standard Google Calendar API calls.

## Slack Integration (Future)

The official Slack MCP server (released Feb 2026) is the recommended path. It requires a Slack app to be approved by workspace admins.

**Steps to enable:**
1. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps and create an app from manifest
2. Add read-only user token scopes: `search:read.public`, `search:read.private`, `channels:history`, `groups:history`, `users:read`, `users:read.email`, `search:read.users`, `search:read.files`
3. Enable MCP under "Agents & AI Apps" in the app settings
4. Submit for workspace admin approval
5. Once approved, configure in `~/.cursor/mcp.json` and update `config.md` with Slack details
